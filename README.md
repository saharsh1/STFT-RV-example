## A linearized approach to radial velocity extraction

This repository contains an implementation of the radial velocity extraction algorithm ([arXiv 2308.05626](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05626))

The analyzed data were generated using [SOAP-GPU](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...671A..11Z/abstract). The analysis contains principal spectra obtained from the [IRSOL Solar Atlas](https://www.irsol.usi.ch/data-archive/clv-ss3/). Use the requirements file to set up the Python environment. Note that the data files are large; Git Large File Storage is required.
